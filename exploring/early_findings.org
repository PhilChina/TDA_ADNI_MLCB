This summarises the early findinds I have on the paper

* Distance between PDs
** Goal
- look at topological heterogeneity of dataset (both within diagnostic
  category as well as overall)
** What I did
- Took all the images from earliest available diagnosis
- Perform cubical persistence
- Calculate distance matrix on persistence diagram or representations thereof
- plot distributions.
** What I found
- There seems to be topological heterogeneity within MCI patients
  according to some distances (could potentially be mapped?).
- Distance functions vary considerably.

* Mapper
** Goal
- Look at topology of the relationship between datapoints
** What I did
- Load images
- Perform PCA with n=2
- Use resulting projected data with Mapper to get the "topological signature" of the ADNI dataset.
** What I found
- Some flares characterise patients in the reasonably well.
- Notable outliers, containing both AD/MCI/CN patients.
- Results are sensitive to parameters/noise.

* Future directions
** Look at robustness of above findings to data in non-MNI space/other preprocessing steps?
** Try out t-SNE/ISOMAP
** Look at other cool things for persistent homology?
