* Spark group meeting <2020-10-06 Tue>
- Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional pipeline for fressurfer?
- Access to repo from Louis?
- Should be able to access the normalized data without any additional
  steps required.

* <2020-09-29 Tue> Meeting - Progress Update #1
** Preparations
- Updates: looked at data, started some exploration of the data and
  the literature. Extracted a graph for one patient, using the following code to extract a
  time series for each voxel for a probabilistic brain atlas
  (=datasets.fetch_atlas_msdl()=).
#+begin_src python
masker = NiftiMapsMasker(maps_img=atlas_filename, standardize=True,
memory='nilearn_cache', verbose=5)
#+end_src
Can nibabel/nilearn do the same as fsl, etc? Haven't found a way to
measure brain volumes yet in nilearn.


- Discuss plan for the analysis pipeline:
1. FSL (Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB F)
  Software Library) - Brain Extraction Tool (BET)
2. Lesion Filling (manual step)
3. Freesurfer - identify brain
   regions  ~82 brain region - This
   is where we look at different atlases. - is that possible?
4. Freesurfer - identify brain volumes for each volume in the selected
   atlas - is that possible?
5. So in each cell of the correlation matrix there is a number between -1
and 1 that represent the Pearson correlation coefficient between
ROIâ€™s. The diagonal elements of the constructed correlation matrix are
set to zero. The structural correlation between a ROI pair of i and j was defined as the Pear-
son correlation coefficient between their mean GM volumes across the subjects
within a group.
OR matrix showing the progression of each voxel using a
linear model over multiple MRIs.
- Remind existence of repository
  https://github.com/pjhartout/TDA_ADNI_MLCB
- =/links/groups/borgwardt/Data/ADNI/brain_extraction-complete_normalized/sub-ADNI002S0295=
  description. Have the images been normalized for brain volume
  already? Provide possibly the code & methodology for the pipeline.
- Get links to zoom meetings/channels where this gets announced.
** Meeting Notes

* <2020-09-29 Tue> SNF Spark Group Meeting
** Louis Lukas presentation
- Code?
- fMRIprep?
- State of the art?
- Look at differences between voxels and ROI.
- Voxel based morphometry pipeline.
- Describe all of the steps you did.
- Check all brain images one by one or don't say it at all.
- fMRIprep creates mask.
- fsl? What does that refer to? ->
  https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslOverview
- Look at masking methods.
** Merel Kuijs presentation
- Check out demographics of the dataset I use.


* <2020-09-23 Wed> Meeting - Preliminaries
** Questions
- How to I get access to the ADNI dataset?
- Do you use VMs or similar as a working environment, or can I work on
  my own machine?
- Regarding internship, ok to sign in as K Borgwardt as supervisor on MyStudies?
- What are the specific goals of the project?
- Discuss also the timeline. Generally, Timeline: AS2020 (sept-dec
  ideally).
** Meeting Notes
Possible directions:
- Focus on the topological analysis of extracted graphs
- Try out different atlases and look at whether there is prior
  knowledge encoded in these, and whether TDA can remove this prior
  knowledge, be indifferent to these graphs.

State of the project:
- MRI images are already processed in a normalized fashion. See
  directory
  /links/groups/borgwardt/Data/ADNI/brain_extraction-complete_normalized/sub-ADNI002S0295
  for the typical patient. Different timepoints are available (up to
  4, at 6 months interval).

Regular meetings:
- Spark group meeting at 3pm
- Weekly one on one, choose slot (probably after Wednesday).

Administrative matters:
- Slack channel [TODO Bastian]
- Server access will be granted when
  registered. Servers are: =bs-borgwardt01= , =bs-borgwardt02=, =euler.ethz.ch=.
- Directory to ADNI directory: links/groups/borgwardt/Data/ADNI
- Look at brain extraction complete normalized within this directory
  for the preprocessed dataset.

Actionable list for next meeting:
- Take common atlas, extract graphs
- Then look at topological descriptors
- Look at packages: https://nilearn.github.io/ and https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/library.html
